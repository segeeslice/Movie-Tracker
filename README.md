Welcome, human, to my Movie Tracker project. I have about a million movies I want to watch eventually, but when I find time to watch them, I tend to forget a lot of them. With this project, I hope to organize my personal movie research while also continuing and showcasing my studies with Javascript, Vue, and Electron.

This project is intended for my personal use, but feel free to pull from it, send me suggestions, etc.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```

This project was generated with [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Documentation about the original structure can be found [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).
