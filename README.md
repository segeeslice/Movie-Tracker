Welcome, person, to my Movie Tracker project. I have about a million movies I want to watch eventually, but when I find time to watch them, I tend to forget a lot of them. With this project, I hope to organize my personal movie research while also continuing my studies with Javascript and Vue.

This project is intended for my personal use, but feel free to pull from it, send me suggestions, etc.
